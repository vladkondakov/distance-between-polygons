This project helps you to find distance between two polygons in 2D.

Upload the .txt file. 
.txt input file includes n and m as a first line, where n - amount of vertices of the first polygon and m - amount of vertices of the second polygon. 
Then n + m lines of points. x and y must be splitted by space. So the example of input file:<br/>
2 1<br/>
5 3<br/>
6 5<br/>
1 1<br/>


The code is bad, because the nodejs best practice was not followed. I'm gonna rewrite it in the future.
Also, the visualization of polygons will be added.
